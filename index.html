                <h3 style="margin-right: 16rem;">Tim Berners Lee</h3>
                <p>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee, is an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, a tech start-up which uses, promotes and helps develop the open source Solid platform. Solid aims to give people control and
                    agency over their data, questioning many assumptions about how the web has to work. Solid technically is a new level of standard at the web layer, which adds things never put into the original spec, such as global single sign-on, universal
                    access control, and a universal data API so that any app can store data in any storage place. Socially Solid is a movement away from much of the issues with the current WWW, and toward a world in which users are in control, and empowered
                    by large amounts of data, private, shared, and public. Sir Tim is the Founder, Emeritus Director, and an Honorary Member of the Board of Directors of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), a Web standards organization that he founded
                    in 1994 which develops interoperable technologies (specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to lead the Web to its full potential. He is a Director of the World Wide Web Foundation which was launched in 2009 to coordinate efforts
                    to further the potential of the Web to benefit humanity.</p>

                <h2 style="margin-top: 10px;">In June 2009</h2>
                <p>In June 2009, then-British prime minister Gordon Brown announced that Berners-Lee would work with the UK government to help make data more open and accessible on the Web, building on the work of the Power of Information Task Force.[48]
                    Berners-Lee and Professor Nigel Shadbolt are the two key figures behind data.gov.uk, a UK government project to open up almost all data acquired for official purposes for free reuse. Commenting on the opening up of Ordnance Survey
                    data in April 2010, Berners-Lee said: "The changes signal a wider cultural change in government based on an assumption that information should be in the public domain unless there is a good reason not to—not the other way around.</p>

                <h2 style="margin-top: 10px;">In November 2009</h2>
                <p> In November 2009, Berners-Lee launched the World Wide Web Foundation (WWWF) in order to campaign to "advance the Web to empower humanity by launching transformative programs that build local capacity to leverage the Web as a medium for
                    positive change".[50] Berners-Lee is one of the pioneer voices in favour of net neutrality,[51] and has expressed the view that ISPs should supply "connectivity with no strings attached", and should neither control nor monitor the
                    browsing activities of customers without their expressed consent.[52][53] He advocates the idea that net neutrality is a kind of human network right: "Threats to the Internet, such as companies or governments that interfere with or
                    snoop on Internet traffic, compromise basic human network rights.</p>

                <h2 style="margin-top: 10px;">In May 2012</h2>
                <p>Berners-Lee joined the board of advisors of start-up State.com, based in London.[56] As of May 2012, he is president of the Open Data Institute,[57] which he co-founded with Nigel Shadbolt in 2012. The Alliance for Affordable Internet
                    (A4AI) was launched in October 2013 and Berners-Lee is leading the coalition of public and private organisations that includes Google, Facebook, Intel. The A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened
                    in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Berners-Lee will work with those aiming to decrease Internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income.[58]
                    Berners-Lee holds the foundersComputer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>

                <p>From the mid 2010s Berners-Lee initially remained neutral on the emerging Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) proposal for with its controversial Digital Rights Management (DRM) implications.[62] In March 2017 he felt he had to take a position which was to support the EME proposal.[62] He reasoned EME's virtues whilst noting DRM was inevitable.[62] As W3C director, he went on to approve the finalised specification in July 2017.[63][62] His stance was opposed by some including Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the anti-DRM campaign Defective by Design and the Free Software Foundation.[63] Varied concerns raised included being not supportive of the Internet's open philosophy against commercial interests and risks of users being forced to use a particular web browser to view specific DRM content.</p>            </div>
